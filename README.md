# pragmatic-rest

## WIP

The idea is to create a stupid simple web app to quickly design a rest api.

Use cases:

1. Designing a new API
2. Documentation
3. Generators


## Goals of pragmatic-rest:

 - Entirely open sourced
 - Modularise everything
 - A simple specification

 TODO

 - Proper tests
 - Push each folder as a npm package, and version correctly.
